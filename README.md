# ClassificationModels
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis by plotting graphs using ggplot2 to find useful meaning in data. Performed data cleaning by handing missing values and data leakage.

Developed classification models using Decision Trees(rpart, C50), Random Forest(Ranger), Boosted tree models(gbm, xgBoost), and Linear(glm) models. Calculated feature importance for all the models.

Compared model performance using confusion matrix, ROC curves, AUC values, and Cost-Based analyses.

XGBoost(eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm performed the best when predicting loan status and actual returns on loans. Combined these two models to optimize the most suitable opportunity for investors that maximizes ROI(Return on Investment).
