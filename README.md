# ClassificationModels
Plotted graphs using ggplot2 to find useful meaning in data. Performed data cleaning by handing missing values and data leakage.

Developed classification models using Decision Trees(rpart, C50), Random Forest(Ranger), Boosted tree models(gbm, xgBoost), and Linear(glm) models. Calculated feature importance for all the models.

Compared model performance using confusion matrix, ROC curves, AUC values, and Cost-Based analyses.
